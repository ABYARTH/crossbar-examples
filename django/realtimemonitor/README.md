Prerequisites:

    pip install --upgrade django requests psutil

Note: The SQLite database file `db.sqlite3` here is needed (for now), since it is preinitialized with necessary database tables already.

There is also a [tutorial covering this example](http://crossbar.io/docs/Adding-Real-Time-to-Django-Applications/) in the Crossbar.io documentation.
