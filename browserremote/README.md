# WAMP browser remote control

Control your browser remotely via WAMP.

* reloading the current page
* navigating to another page
* displaying a page in a second tab

**Reload** enables you to refresh content which is displayed remotely.

**Navigating to another page** allows you to chain content, if you can modify all pages to load this control code.

**Displaying a page in a second tab** enables you to sequence arbitrary web pages for display. This requires allowing pop-ups for the domain the controlled page is served from.

These features are just a basic set, and can be easily extended to other control should you need this. For example, you could navigate the browser history or even modify page content.
